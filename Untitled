2. Install perl

3. Use the MOSS script provided in the email, save it as `moss.pl`
  - Alternatively, `wget http://moss.stanford.edu/general/scripts/mossnet -O moss.pl`

4. Clone student repositories with GitHub Classroom CLI
  - `gh classroom clone <assignment-url>`

5. Run MOSS Script
  ```
  perl moss.pl -l c -b <path_to_base_projX_main.c> -b <path_to_base_system_msp432p401r.c> -d <cloned_student_repo_path>/*/*.c <cloned_student_repo_path>/*/*.h
  ```
